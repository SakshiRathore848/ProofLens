# ProofLens: A Lightweight Consensus Mechanism for IoT Devices

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
ProofLens introduces a lightweight blockchain-based consensus mechanism tailored for IoT devices. 
It allows IoT devices to submit data proofs, validators to approve/reject them, and the system 
to finalize consensus based on a simple majority mechanism.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
To enable secure, transparent, and efficient consensus among IoT devices with minimal 
computational overhead, ensuring trustworthy data verification in smart environments.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- IoT devices can submit hashed proofs.
- Validators can vote (approve/reject).
- Simple majority-based consensus mechanism.
- Event logs for transparency.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Integration with real IoT sensor networks.
- Role-based access (validators vs devices).
- Energy-efficient consensus improvements.
- Deployment on private IoT-focused blockchains.
